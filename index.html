  <h1>One Minute Ascension</h1>


  <h2>Origins</h2>

  <p>
    Before the world of man, there existed only Genesis. Forming the cosmos from their hair, galaxies from their tears, and the realms across their body. Sitting on their throne, creating worlds yet having no company. It seeks to life in 
    these realms to have some company and amusement. In the realm later named Cavak, it creates the Yokai. Ethereal creatures of light that draw power from the concepts and elements of the realms. These creatures brought great joy to 
    Genesis' rather boring existence. Unfortunately, These yokai were fiercely loyal to Genesis, to point they disregarded their own will and solely followed Genesis' word as law. Genesis thought it could anything in the shape that it 
    wish, but it seems that WILL it something it doesn't have full control over. So it tries again and again and again, each resulting their own unique failures. Dragons were too powerful and solitary. They were uninterested anything 
    that wasn't about themselves. Demons were a similar case but with the added pain them trying to corrupt other races. The Void was the worst outcome for Genesis. A Hive mind which WILL was filled with so much malice towards everything,
    even its own creator that Genesis was forced to isolated from the other realms in fear of it disrupting the balance it is trying to create. But then, after trials upon trials, it found the formula to create what it sought. A creature
    that reveres it but also the creatures own WILL gives it complete freedom of thought. The prototype of this formula was Man. This was the first in a series of creatures that spawn from this formula. The next race was the Valkyrie, 
    and all female race that look similar in appearance to Man but they also have wings. Dwarves were made with a defect that cut not only their size in half but also their intelligence, but their WILL gave them properties to makes bits 
    off their imagination into reality. 

    Unfortunately, Man was given too much freedom of thought. Despite their lack of strength, they thoight that their intelligence was so high that they the other race were below them. Man inslaved the Dwarves to construct all manner of 
    tools and weapons. Man thought the Valkyrie were to full of themselves and went to war with them. Seeking to add them to their pile of slaves. The plan of demons rarely ever went their way, but Man was easily Manipulable by them. Using 
    this to their advantage, Demons controlled key figures of Man to incite war with the Dragons and the Yokai. Witness the conflict and question its own judgement, Genesis wonders if it was a mistake to create a create with so much freedom.
    In dissappointment, it cast Man from its body, casting it into the abyss, with the Void at the realm of Man's door. This leave to the Void ravaging the realm.
