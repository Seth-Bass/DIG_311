  <h2>Origins</h2>

  <p>
    Before the world of man, there existed only Genesis. Forming the cosmos from their hair, galaxies from their tears, and the realms across their body. Sitting on their throne, creating worlds yet having no company. It seeks to life in these realms to have some company and amusement.
