  <h1>One Minute Ascension</h1>


  <h2>Origins</h2>

  <p>
    Before the world of man, there existed only Genesis. Forming the cosmos from their hair, galaxies from their tears, and the realms across their body. Sitting on their throne, creating worlds yet having no company. It seeks to life in 
    these realms to have some company and amusement. In the realm later named Cavak, it creates the Yokai. Ethereal creatures of light that draw power from the concepts and elements of the realms. These creatures brought great joy to 
    Genesis' rather boring existence. Unfortunately, These yokai were fiercely loyal to Genesis, to point they disregarded their own will and solely followed Genesis' word as law. Genesis thought it could anything in the shape that it 
    wish, but it seems that WILL it something it doesn't have full control over. So it tries again and again and again, each resulting their own unique failures. Dragons were too powerful and solitary. They were uninterested anything 
    that wasn't about themselves. Demons were a similar case but with the added pain them trying to corrupt other races. The Void was the worst outcome for Genesis. A Hive mind which WILL was filled with so much malice towards everything,
    even its own creator that Genesis was forced to isolated from the other realms in fear of it disrupting the balance it is trying to create. But then, after trials upon trials, it found the formula to create what it sought. A creature
    that reveres it but also the creatures own WILL gives it complete freedom of thought. The prototype of this formula was Man.
